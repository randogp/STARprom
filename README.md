# BC-STAR-PROM

We designed a widely applicable method to identify signal-activated transcription factors (TFs) without any prior knowledge of their properties. To establish proof of concept for BC-STAR-PROM, we applied it to the identification of TFs induced by drugs affecting actin and tubulin cytoskeleton dynamics.

This repository is associated to the original publication:

Original step-by-step protocol
Final publication (open access)

Both script and protocol were written for personal use. For more information contact:
